                    <p>With the expanding horizon of digital technology, there is also an increasing need for software professionals with a good command of a variety of programming languages. The C language is one of the basic skill sets in a programmerâ€™s portfolio.

There has been an explosion in the number of programming languages and different development platforms. However, the C programming language has retained its popularity across the decades.

Let Us C is a great resource from which one can learn C programming. It does not assume any previous knowledge of C or even the basics of programming. It covers everything from basic programming concepts and fundamental C programming constructs.

                               <p>TBeginning with the basics, the book first introduces mathematics and its nuances to the students and explains the difference between applied mathematics and engineering mathematics. Fundamental topics such as sequence and series and matrices are discussed with the applications to engineering problems. Other important topics such as three-dimensional geometry, functions of single variable and several variables, differential calculus, integral calculus, Fourier series, Fourier transform, Fourier integrals, ordinary differential equations
                                    Most of the chapters comprise sections on applications to engineering problems. There are separate chapters discussing the applications of the mathematical theorems and numerical methods to engineering problems.
